###$whoami?
I'm Blagovest Petrov, an ordinary system administrator from Sofia, Bulgaria.

###Occupation & Education
I currently work at [NeboSystems](http://nebosystems.eu), a small company for IT services. I've been working here since 2009.
I went to "Professional high school of telecomunications", graduated in 2011.
Then I tried "Applied Mathematics and Informatics" in the Technical University of Sofia for a year, but .. that's a long story. I didn't have enough free time and the education material was too outdated. Except of the maths, the programming was mainly in Pascal and Delphi. It's much easier to learn from online sources like Coursera, Khan Academy or Youtube. 
Now i'm officialy interrupted Automatics student in the Mining and Geology university of Sofia, but it's even worse.
