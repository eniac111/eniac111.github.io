###$whoami?
I'm Blagovest Petrov, an ordinary system administrator from Sofia, Bulgaria. 

There must be a content here?! If someone is more interested about me, the social buttons are on top of the page. You can freely stalk me :)

About the music, my last.fm profile is [here](http://last.fm/user/eniac111)

hmm.. I like biking, hiking, interesting beers..
